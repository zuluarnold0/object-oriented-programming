OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING:
----------------------------
# uses objects rather than functions
# is object oriented rather than procedural
# is made of:
            -> encapsulation
            -> abstraction
            -> inheritance
            -> polymorphism

(*) Encapsulation:
    -> Using related properties and methods in an object

(*) Abstraction:
    -> Only showing essential methods and hiding the details

(*) Inheritance:
    -> Using functionality from another method therefore reducing redundancy of code

(*) Polymorphism:
    -> Refactoring ugly if/else or switch/case statements
